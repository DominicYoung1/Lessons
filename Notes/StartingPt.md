## Dom's Staring Pt.

Python:
  - Based off of w3 schools tutorials.
  - Simple language familiarity / Code Flow

Project:
  - A grocery store shopping simulator
  - Choose aisles to go down, pick items, add to shopping cart, decrement inventory. Sum up total cost.
  - Some understanding of O.O. Mostly just in terms of defining structs. Not inheritence/polymorphism. Difficulty with what constitutes a class or how to group code.
