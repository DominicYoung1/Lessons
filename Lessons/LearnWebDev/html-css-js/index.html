    WITHOUT ABSOLUTE SPACING:
      1. it's going to auto-calculate everything.
         renders h2 first. That's going to have some height (100px).
      2. Start to render p. Since h2 in step (1) took up 100px, it draws
         the p 100 pixels shifted down.

    WITH ABSOLUTE SPACING:
      1. It sees we specified explicitly where the header should go.
         so it doesn't auto-calculate anything.
