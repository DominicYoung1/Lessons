# Lesson Plans

There are a lot of steps to learning web. Modern web development involves learning a bunch of different technologies. Most of these you don't need to know in depth, but should have some familiarity with.

# Technologies to learn

### Frontend
1. HTML
   1. HyperText Markup Language
   2. HTML is used to specify elements of a website (headers, paragraphs, images, etc.). It is NOT an actual programming language
   3. It consist of elements demarcated with tags. Elements may also have attributes to provice more context (ex. the URL of a image that should be shown).
2. CSS
   1. CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
   2. CSS is used to add styling (fonts, colors, spacing, mobile/desktop versions of how to lay out a website, etc.)
   3. It works hand-in-hand with html. They are definitely designed with each other in mind.
3. Javascript/DOM management
   1. Javascript is a full programming language. It is used to add interractivity / dynamic elements to HTML
   2. The way it works is by modifying the html file that the web browser is rendering.
   3. The traditional / "out of the box" way to do this is by manipulating the DOM

Practice: Make a simple "About me" website.
1. html with css and links
2. Links to another page with contact info


3. React
4. Typescript
5. Node.js
6. AJAX
7. WebSockets
